Ford Gobik Data Exploration and Explanation analysis

Dataset

The data of the ford gobike system contains alot of parameter so at first i was in need to clean up 
such variables and this performs based on the exploration data analysis stage.After that to find the 
relation between such variables i used another analysis staretgy called explanatory analysis.Both analysis
approaches carried out using the python and data visulization analysis tools.

In exploration data analysis stage, has found that the dataset based on 16 parameter such as;trip duration, member gender, user type ....etc.,
from this stage of analysis has determined the main parameters will carry out the analysis based on 
their distribution to find the relation between them in the explanatory analysis stage using sub-analysis
tools called bivariant and multivariant anakysis to extract the follwing conculsions.

Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis carried out , i can say that there is a stronh relation between the certain user paremeters such as the type ;subsucriber or customer ,gender and age )and the trip duration as the small ages less than 40 has long trip duration and it appers also the effect of the gender and user types by its two categories ,also the subscriber type has  longer trip duration for user has ages around 50.

Key Insights For Presentation

From the distribuation of the trip duration, we can observe that the amount of the trips was huge at first more than 8000 trip which has trip duration approximetly 600 sec. but the number of trips has 
decreased after that around 1000 trip.By same sight to the the features of the the user age distribution 
as the number of the trips very high for users their ages less than 40.
